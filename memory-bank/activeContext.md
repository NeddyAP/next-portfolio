# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Development phase of the portfolio application is considered complete.
- All planned CRUD operations for all sections have been successfully implemented.
- The Contact section has been refactored to a simpler design that displays contact email from Supabase.
- Next major focus is implementing comprehensive test code for all operations and components.

## Recent Changes
- **Contact Section Refactoring:**
    - Refactored `src/components/Contact.tsx` to remove EmailJS-based contact form.
    - Simplified to display a "Get in Touch" section in a Card component.
    - Added email display from Supabase's `aboutData.contact_email` field.
    - Removed phone number display as it's not part of the schema.
    - Removed client-side state management for form handling.
    - Eliminated EmailJS dependency and form submission logic.
    
- **Completion of All CRUD Operations:**
    - All sections now have appropriate CRUD functionality implemented:
        - About Me: Update functionality
        - Skills: Full CRUD
        - Tools: Full CRUD
        - Hobbies: Full CRUD
        - Experience: Full CRUD
        - Projects: Full CRUD with image upload
        - Certificates: Full CRUD with image/PDF upload

- **Memory Bank Updates:**
    - Created new memory bank entries documenting the final Contact section implementation.
    - Added detailed documentation of the next project phase focusing on testing.
    - Updated progress tracking to reflect completion of development phase.

## Next Steps
- **Implement Comprehensive Test Suite:** 
  - Create unit tests for components and utility functions
  - Develop integration tests for CRUD operations
  - Implement end-to-end tests for key user flows
  - Set up testing framework (Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright/Cypress)
- **Address Deprecation:** Plan to migrate from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` to `@supabase/ssr` for auth handling in API routes (`/api/about-me`, `/api/upload`).
- **Review and Refine:** Review the overall application code for consistency, optimization opportunities, and potential improvements.
- **Deployment Preparation:** Ensure all environment variables and configurations are properly set up for production deployment.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **File Uploads:** The `/api/upload` endpoint now handles 'profile', 'resume', 'project', and 'certificate' types, storing them in distinct subdirectories within `public/uploads/`.
- **Displaying Certificate Files:** `Certificate.tsx` now conditionally renders an `<img>` tag (via `next/image`) or the `PDFViewer` based on the file extension of `certificate_image_url`.

## Important Patterns and Preferences (Reinforced)
- **Iterative CRUD Implementation:** Section by section.
- **Component-Based Editing:** Dedicated form components within `Sheet` components.
- **Client-Side Supabase Operations for CRUD:** Standard for CUD operations.
- **API Route for File Uploads:** Centralized handling.
- **Path Revalidation/Refresh:** `router.refresh()`.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Unified File Upload API:** The `/api/upload` route is proving flexible enough to handle various file types and associated logic (like deleting old files) for different sections by using a `type` parameter.
