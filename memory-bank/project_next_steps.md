## Next Phase: Comprehensive Testing
The next major development phase is implementing a comprehensive test suite to ensure the application's reliability and maintainability. This testing should cover all critical operations and components:

### Testing Areas to Focus On
1. **API Route Testing:**
   - CRUD operations for all sections
   - File upload, replacement, and deletion handling
   - Authentication and authorization checks

2. **Component Testing:**
   - Proper rendering of all components
   - State management within components
   - Interaction between components
   - Responsiveness across screen sizes

3. **Authentication Flow Testing:**
   - Login process
   - Session management
   - Protected route/action behavior

4. **Form Testing:**
   - Form submissions and validations
   - Error handling
   - Success handling

5. **Data Fetching and Display:**
   - Data loading states
   - Error states
   - Proper data presentation

### Recommended Testing Tools
- **Jest:** For unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library:** For component testing
- **Playwright or Cypress:** For end-to-end testing
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker):** For mocking API requests

### Testing Strategy
1. Start with unit tests for utility functions and small components
2. Move to integration tests for larger component interactions
3. End with end-to-end tests for critical user flows
4. Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing on code changes

## Future Enhancement Possibilities
After testing is complete, potential future enhancements could include:
- Blog section with content management
- Enhanced animations and micro-interactions
- SEO optimization
- Analytics integration
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility improvements
