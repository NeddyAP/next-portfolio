# Progress

## What Works
- **Core Website Structure:** Next.js application with components for Hero, About Me, Portfolio, Experience, Certificates, Contact.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui integrated.
- **Data Display (Mostly Migrated to Supabase):**
    - **About Me:** Data fetched from Supabase.
    - **Experience:** Data fetched from Supabase.
    - **Certificates:** Data fetched from Supabase.
    - **Portfolio:** Data fetched from Supabase.
    - Contact section still uses local data or is static.
- **Supabase Integration:**
    - Supabase client setup (`src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`).
    - Environment variables for Supabase configured.
    - Tables created in Supabase: `about_me`, `experiences`, `certificates`, `projects`.
    - Migration script (`scripts/migrateData.mjs`) populates these tables.
    - RLS policies adjusted for public read access on `about_me`, `experiences`, `certificates`, and `projects` tables.
- **`iconMap.tsx` (Previous):** Updated with necessary icons for About Me and Experience sections.
- **Navigation:** Basic navigation functional.
- **Responsiveness:** Initial responsiveness via Tailwind CSS.
- **Theming:** `ThemeProvider` in place.
- **Memory Bank:** Core documents established and being updated.

## What's Left to Build / Enhance
- **Supabase Integration for Remaining Sections:**
    - **Contact Section:** Determine if it needs to be dynamic (e.g., storing contact messages in Supabase). If so:
        - Define schema for `contacts` table.
        - Update migration script.
        - Refactor `Contact.tsx` component.
        - Update `page.tsx` to fetch/pass data if needed, or handle form submission to Supabase.
        - Set RLS for `contacts` table (likely restricted write access, public read if displaying messages).
- **Develop Custom In-Page Visual Editor (Currently on Hold):**
    - **Authentication (using Supabase Auth):**
        - Test existing `LoginForm` and auth flow.
        - Implement signup forms if needed.
        - Create/refine API routes in Next.js for auth actions.
        - Manage user sessions.
    - **Backend CRUD API Routes (Next.js):**
        - Create API routes for Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for each content type, interacting with Supabase (secured by auth).
    - **Frontend Editing UI (React Components):**
        - Build drawer components.
        - Develop forms for each content type.
        - Implement UI logic for edit controls based on auth state.
- **Thorough Testing:**
    - Test data display from Supabase for all sections.
    - Test editing workflows and data persistence (once editor is built).
    - Rigorously test authentication flow (once revisited).
- **Deployment Setup Review:**
    - Ensure Supabase environment variables are correctly configured in Vercel (or other host).
- **Memory Bank Refinement:** Continuously update.
- **Other Potential Enhancements (Post-Editor):**
    - Blog section.
    - Animations/micro-interactions.
    - Image optimization (Supabase Storage can help).
    - SEO.

## Current Status
- **Phase:** Iterative migration of portfolio sections to use Supabase as a backend.
- **Current Activity:** Successfully migrated the **Portfolio** section to Supabase.
- **Next Major Task:** Evaluate and potentially integrate the Contact section with Supabase.
- **Blockers:** None currently for Supabase data migration. Authentication/Editor UI development is on hold by user preference.

## Known Issues
- **Migration Script Idempotency:**
    - `about_me` and `projects` tables use `upsert` (projects has a fallback to `insert` if `upsert` constraint fails). This is generally good for re-running the script.
    - `experiences` and `certificates` tables still use `insert`. Re-running the script for these without clearing the tables first will likely result in duplicate key errors or warnings. Consider changing to `upsert` for these as well if frequent re-runs are expected.
- **Schema Mismatches (Previously Resolved for Certificates):** Encountered and resolved "column not found" errors during certificate integration. This highlights the ongoing need for careful schema management across Supabase, TypeScript types, and migration scripts.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Decision (Implied):** Build a modern, responsive portfolio using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui with static data.
- **Memory Bank Decision:** Establish a comprehensive "Memory Bank" documentation system.
- **Enhancement Path Chosen:** Migrate data from local files to a Supabase backend.
- **Future Enhancement (On Hold):** Build a custom in-page visual editor with Supabase Auth, replacing the original idea of a Headless CMS.
