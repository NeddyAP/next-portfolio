# Contact Section - Final Implementation

## Overview
The `Contact.tsx` component has been refactored to remove the EmailJS-based contact form. It now displays a simplified "Get in Touch" section. The primary contact method displayed is the email address fetched from `aboutData.contact_email`. The phone number display was removed as the `phone_number` field is not part of the `about_me` table schema. The contact information is presented within a `shadcn/ui Card` component for better visual structure.

## Key Changes
- Removed EmailJS integration and form-based contact functionality
- Eliminated client-side state for form handling
- Removed toast notifications related to form submission
- Implemented a clean Card-based UI for displaying contact information
- Uses email from Supabase's `about_me` table (`contact_email` field)

## Implementation Details
- Uses `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, and `CardContent` from shadcn/ui
- Provides a clickable email link with a mail icon
- Includes fallback text when contact email is not available
- Maintains responsive design with appropriate spacing and container classes
- Features hover effects on the email link for better user interaction

## Technical Considerations
- Component still marked as "use client" but no longer strictly requires it
- Still accepts `aboutData` props from the `about_me` table
- No longer depends on useState, useEffect, Input, Textarea, Button, or toast components
- No longer requires EmailJS library

## Future Considerations
- May be integrated with additional contact methods if the schema is expanded
- Could be enhanced with social media links if desired
